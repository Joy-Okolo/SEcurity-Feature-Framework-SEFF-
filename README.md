Predictive Vulnerability Detection: Using machine learning models to predict potential vulnerabilities in Programming Languages based on SEcurity Feature Framework (SEFF) criteria
SEFF is a valuable tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities in software code by assessing security features and patterns. However, the traditional approach of SEFF relies heavily on manual analysis, which can be
time-consuming and prone to human error. To address these limitations, we integrated machine learning techniques with SEFF to create a more automated and precise vulnerability detection mechanism. By combining SEFF's
structured analysis with the predictive power of machine learning, we aim to transform the way software vulnerabilities are identified and addressed, enhancing both speed and accuracy.
